*🌴 Kerala Smart Weather Prediction System
🌤 1. Introduction

Weather prediction plays a vital role in daily life — from agriculture to transportation and disaster management.
This project, “Kerala Smart Weather Predictor”, uses machine learning to predict the weather of any district in Kerala based on the date selected by the user.
It’s a data-driven system built using Python and Streamlit for real-time prediction and visualization.
 
 2. Objective of the Project

The main objectives are:
To develop a machine learning model that can predict future weather conditions for Kerala districts.
To build an interactive web app that allows users to input a district and date.
To demonstrate how data science and AI can help in local-level forecasting and planning.

🗺 3. Why Weather Prediction is Important

Weather prediction is useful for:
🌾 Farmers: Helps in deciding irrigation, sowing, and harvesting time.
🧱 Construction: Helps in planning outdoor activities safely.
🚗 Transportation: Ensures road, sea, and air transport safety.
🚨 Disaster management: Predicts extreme weather events like floods or heavy rainfall.
👨‍👩‍👧 General public: Helps in travel planning and daily preparation.
